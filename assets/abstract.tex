	\acrshortpl{mof}, thanks to their ultra high porosity and surface area, are
	deemed as prominent candidates for applications involving gas adsorption.
	However, their intrinsic combinatorial nature, translates to a practically
	infinite material space, rendering the identification of novel materials
	with traditional methods cumbersome. Over the last years, \acrlong{ml}
	approaches based on predictive models have been developed, allowing
	researchers to rapidly screen large databases of \acrshortpl{mof}. The
	quality of these models highly depends on the mathematical representation of
	a material, thus necessitating the use of informative inputs. In this
	thesis, we propose a generalized framework for predicting gas adsorption
	properties, using as one and only input the \acrlong{pes}. We treat the
	latter as a 3D energy image and then pass it through 3D \acrlong{cnn}, known
	for its ability to process image-like data. The proposed pipeline
	is applied in \acrshortpl{mof} for predicting \ch{CO2} uptake. The resulting
	model outperforms both in terms of performance and data efficiency a
	conventional one built upon textual properties. Additionally, we demonstrate
	the transferability of the approach to other host-guest systems, by
	examining \ch{CH4} uptake in \acrlongpl{cof}. Finally, discussion for
	improving and extending the suggested scheme is provided.
